Webpage Alignment Grid
======================

This is a simple bookmarklet that puts overlays over a web page to help with alignment during development.

There are three modes available. A 10 pixel grid, a 20 pixel grid, and a 4 column overlay.

Usage
-----

Upload the javascript, css, and images to your server, changing YOURDOMAIN to, well, your domain.

Paste the contents of bookmarklet.txt into a bookmark in your web browser of choice. Again, make sure to change the reference to YOURDOMAIN.

Clicking the bookmarket will create a box with three options. Selecting one of the options will overlay the appropriate grid or column image.

To get rid of the overlay, you can click the bookmarklet a second time.
