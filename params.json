  "body": "Webpage Alignment Grid\r\n======================\r\n\r\nThis is a simple bookmarklet that puts overlays over a web page to help with alignment during development.\r\n\r\nThere are three modes available. A 10 pixel grid, a 20 pixel grid, and a 4 column overlay.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n__GitHub Hosting__  \r\nBy default, all the links and references are pointed to the files hosted here on GitHub. Simply paste the contents of bookmarklet.txt into a new bookmark in your favorites bar or wherever, (my feelings will not be hurt). Changes made to functionality will be reflected automatically as you use it.\r\n\r\n__Self-Hosting__  \r\nIf you want to host this yourself, upload the javascript, css, and images to your server, changing the github URLs to your domain.\r\n\r\nPaste the contents of bookmarklet.txt into a bookmark in your web browser of choice. Again, make sure to change the reference to GitHub to correctly point to your server.\r\n\r\nClicking the bookmarket will create a box with three options. Selecting one of the options will overlay the appropriate grid or column image.\r\n\r\nOne day I would like to improve this to make the options a bit more flexible, and I need to style the control box so it looks better.\r\n\r\nTo get rid of the overlay, you can click the bookmarklet a second time or refresh the page.",
